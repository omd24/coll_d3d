# coll_d3d
A collection of diverse d3d[12] samples experimenting with more adventurous topics
In this repo, I implemented the following topics so far:
 - Dynamic Indexing
 - Frustum Culling & Instancing (https://youtu.be/NWaZ4oGrkZw)
 - Ray Picking 
 - Normal Mapping
 - Cube/Environment Maps
 - Shadow Mapping
 - Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

My reference for these topics: Frank D. Luna, 3D Game Programming with D3D12 (http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d12.htm).
The following video specifically shows the output of the SSAO demo (the most recent project):
